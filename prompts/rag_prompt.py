1. Reasoning: It is well-established that regular A consumption has the potential to reduce C levels. Although there is no direct evidence linking A to B, the triple provided in the additional context mentions that C is a risk factor for B. So it can be assumed that A reduces the risk of B disease by lowering C levels.
